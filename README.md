# Cats vs. dogs classifier

Training a small model using [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), and [keras](https://keras.io/) to identify images of cats and dogs.

This model uses 3 [2D convolution](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/Conv2D), and 2 [densely-connected NN](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/Dense) layers.
